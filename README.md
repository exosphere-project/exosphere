# Exosphere: the User-Friendliest Interface for Non-proprietary Cloud Infrastructure

- Empowers researchers and other non-IT professionals to deploy code and run services on [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org)-based cloud systems, without advanced virtualization or networking knowledge
- Fills the gap between OpenStack interfaces built for system administrators (like [Horizon](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/)), and intuitive-but-proprietary services like [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail)
- Enables cloud operators to deliver a friendly, powerful interface to their community with customized branding, nomenclature, and single sign-on integration

## Try Exosphere

- Visit **[try.exosphere.app](https://try.exosphere.app)** if you have access to an existing OpenStack cloud with internet-facing APIs
- Use **[jetstream2.exosphere.app](https://jetstream2.exosphere.app)** if you have an allocation on [Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/)
- [Run Exosphere locally](docs/run-exosphere.md) if you don't want to use our hosted site

## Overview and Features

_Wait, what is OpenStack? [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) is the operating system and APIs that power public research clouds like [Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org) and [Chameleon](https://www.chameleoncloud.org), private clouds at organizations like [Wikimedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Cloud_Services_team) and [CERN](https://clouddocs.web.cern.ch/), and public commercial clouds like [OVH](https://us.ovhcloud.com/public-cloud/), [Fuga](https://fuga.cloud/), [Vexxhost](https://vexxhost.com/), and [Leafcloud](https://leaf.cloud). Any organization can run OpenStack on its own hardware to provide a cloud service for its own community, or for the world._

What can I do with Exosphere?

- Create instances to run your code, and volumes to manage your data
  - Works great for containers, intensive compute jobs, disposable experiments, and persistent web services
- Get **one-click, browser-based shell and graphical desktop** access to cloud instances (via [Apache Guacamole](http://guacamole.apache.org))
- **Pretty graphs** show an instance's resource usage at a glance
- If you're a cloud operator, deliver a customized interface with white-labeling, localization, and single sign-on
- 100% self-hostable, 99% standalone client application
  - Two small proxy servers secure web browser connections to OpenStack APIs, and interactive services running on cloud instances
- On the [roadmap](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/issues?label_name[]=long-term+goal):
  - First-class support for [container](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/issues/82) and [data science workbench](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/issues/717) resources
  - [Cluster orchestration](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/issues/317)
  - [Community-curated deployment automations](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/issues/573) for scientific workflows and custom services
- Free, open source, and open development process -- come hack with us!
  - See Exosphere's [values and goals](docs/values-goals.md)

## Exosphere's Impact

- [Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org), a science and engineering research cloud, offers Exosphere as its primary user interface. Jetstream2 is available to any US-based researcher.
- Exosphere has [a $298k award](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2229642) from the US National Science Foundation's [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose). Read about it in [this news release](https://itnews.iu.edu/articles/2022/IU-wins-300K-NSF-award-to-build-an-open-source-ecosystem-around-heavily-used-cloud-tool.php).
