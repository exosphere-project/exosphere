# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Effective: 2026-02-24

## Applicability

This policy applies to:

- Projects in the Exosphere GitLab namespace <https://gitlab.com/exosphere>.
- The Exosphere hosted sites as enumerated in the [Acceptable Use Policy](acceptable-use-policy.md).
- The `exosphere.app` domain name, DNS, and everything that is served within it.

If you are reporting a vulnerability in a third-party deployment of Exosphere that is not operated by the Exosphere project, please report it to that deployment's operators.

## Reporting

### How to Report

Please create a new issue in the Exosphere GitLab project and turn on confidentiality:

- [Create a new issue](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/issues/new?type=ISSUE).
- Check the "Turn on confidentiality" checkbox before submitting.

If you cannot use GitLab, contact maintainers directly:

- Message maintainers on Matrix (if needed, start in [#exosphere:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#exosphere:matrix.org) and ask to move to a private room without posting vulnerability details publicly).
- Send email to one or both of these addresses (replace `%`):
  - Replace `%` with `i`: `jul%an@jul%anp%stor%us.com`
  - Replace `%` with `e`: `t%%.kyl%@gmail.com`

### Response Timeline

When possible, we will:

- Acknowledge receipt within 7 calendar days.
- Request additional details if needed.
- Provide status updates at least every 14 calendar days while a report is active.

Resolution time depends on severity, scope, and maintainer capacity.

### Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement within 7 calendar days:

- Re-send your report to both maintainer email addresses above.
- Include `SECURITY REPORT ESCALATION` in the subject line.
- If needed, ask in [#exosphere:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#exosphere:matrix.org) for a private channel without posting vulnerability details publicly.

Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly before we have had a reasonable chance to investigate and address them.

### What to Include in a Report

Please include as much of the following as you can:

- A short summary of the suspected vulnerability.
- Affected component, URL, and version/commit (if known).
- Steps to reproduce.
- Evidence (request/response samples, screenshots, logs, or proof-of-concept).
- Estimated scope, severity, and impact (what an attacker can do).

If you used AI-assisted tools, include a short self-certification that you reviewed and validated the reported behavior to the best of your ability.

## Good-Faith Research and Safe Harbor

If you make a good-faith effort to follow this policy, we will not pursue legal action against you for your security research.

Please:

- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond the minimum steps required to confirm and demonstrate them.
- Do not access, modify, or delete data that is not your own.
- Do not intentionally disrupt services, degrade availability, or harm users.
- Stop testing and report promptly after you confirm a plausible vulnerability.

This policy does not authorize actions that violate law or regulations.
