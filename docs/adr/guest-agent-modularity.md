# ADR 7: Modularity of Exosphere Guest Agent

## Status

Draft

## Context

We are in the process of developing an Exosphere Guest Agent (referred to as 'guest agent', or 'agent' in the rest of the document.)
See [ADR 6: Exosphere Guest Utilities service on instances](guest-utilities.md) for more information.

Open questions:

- How do we ensure that newer versions of the Exosphere application will work with older versions of the agent?
- How do we ensure that older versions of the Exosphere application will work with newer versions of the agent?
- How do we test the agent?
- How do we build the agent?
- How do we package the agent?
- How do we distribute the agent?
- Should we keep the agent in its own repository, or should we bring it into the Exosphere application repository?
